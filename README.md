## 5. Conclusion
With the team effort, we have delivered some features of the website:

- Manage multiple models with CRUD functions: Film, Genre, Actor, Video, Photo, Rating, Contribution,...

- Account:
    + Create, view, update, delete user account;
    + Implement Password Hashing function for better security.
      
- Film:
    + Create, view, update, delete, search and filter Films by multiple conditions;
    + Implement Pagination from database for better performance when searching/viewing
    + Use Firebase Cloud storage for data storing (film's photo, user's photo).

- Watchlist:
    + Create many playlist to watch laterr
    + Add favourite films to the playlist
 
- Contribution:
    + Allow users to contribute new films or contribute videos, genres and photos to a existed film
    + Admin check the contribution after user submitted to publish the contribution to the website or reject it

During the coding time, we also spent much time to provide good UI for the functions above.

However, due to our lack of time and skill, we have yet hit the threshold of a smoothly well functioning website:
- Haven't organized the project structure carefully from the start, which leads to inefficient coding process, difficulties in developing and maintaining in the future.
- Many flaws in user flow (Example: only annouce to user but not sending email for them after admin checking contribution)
- Unfinished views (Example: WatchList view in the Landing Page)
- Some unstable methods (Example: Edit Profile View)

And now that we have submitted our assignment, we can reflect on our progress. 
Throughout this project, we learned and strengthened our knowledge not only in tools like Figma, Git, Github, but also in coding techniques and mindset, both front-end and back-end. Looking further, it was all thanks to the advice and feedback of our lecturer that we could see the problems more clearly and figure out the solutions. We are deeply grateful for his help in this tough semester. This is a valuable experience that help us to further our careers in this field.
